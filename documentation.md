The codes are built for the assignment 05 of course GEOG 825, opened by the University of Saskatchewan. This assignment exercise helps to understand how to use a high-performance computing cluster to run a large ensemble of simulations, and then perform a visual assessment of these simulations by creating statistic maps of specific hydrologic signatures.

(1) part1.submit_all_catchments.sh. This bash script sets up the parallel SUMMA simulations for 671 catchments that are part of the CAMELS dataset (Addor et al. 2017). This code features in using the environment variable SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID to submit multiple jobs in an automatic manner. The submission command is sbatch --array.

(2) part2.signature.ipynb. This is a jupyter notebook script. It calculates three hydrological signatures using the observed flows and the simulated flows generated by SUMMA; then plots the distributions of the signatures for visual assessment of simulations. 

Here are some details about the three hydrological signatures (Addor et al. 2017):
 -- Mean daily discharge [mm/day].
 -- Frequency of high-flow days (> 9 times the median daily flow) [days/year].
 -- Frequency of low-flow days (< 0.2 times the mean daily flow) [days/year].
